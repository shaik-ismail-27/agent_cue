    description: "This flow manages the payment process for users booking a appointment which requires payment. After receiving a payment requirement, this flow processes the payment transaction using the payment method information previously collected.

In the event of a payment failure, the flow provides clear feedback and offer options for retrying the payment with either the same card or a different card."
