  gather_booking_data:
    description: "This flow is responsible for gathering essential patient information and managing the transition to account verification or creation as part of the appointment process. After a user has selected a clinic and an available appointment slot, this flow collects the patient's full name and age, ensuring that the booking is personalized and accurate. It then determines whether the user already has an account with the clinic or service by asking a direct question. Based on the user's response, the flow either initiates the account verification process for existing users or guides new users through account creation."
