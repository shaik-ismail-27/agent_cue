  general_health_checkup:
    description: "This flow serves as the entry point for users seeking to book a general health checkup appointment. It guides the user through the initial steps of the booking process, starting with collecting the user's preferred city and state of the clinic, which are essential for recommending suitable clinics based on the user's specified location. After gathering this information, the flow triggers the clinic recommendation action, which searches for available clinics offering general health checkup services in the specified area. Depending on the outcome, the user is either directed to select a clinic, informed if clinics/service is not available in their region and the again prompts the user to provide a different city and state. This flow ensures a personalized and location-specific start to the appointment booking journey, setting the stage for subsequent steps such as clinic selection, appointment scheduling, and patient information collection."
